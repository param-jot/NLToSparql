This repository has Colab Notebooks to train the REFORMER model for NER, Entity Linking, and Relation Extraction. The models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FwRjO0Pn3-AaEzWlKV7q0Vp2bOilC6X0?usp=sharing). The Notebook LC_QuaD.ipynb generates an annotated dataset (LCQuADDataset.csv) for Named Entity Recognition from LC-QuAD questions. 

The integration of the NER, EL, and RE models in TeBaQA's entity-linking module can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15QWtl23sYgLrpl1vrW7iA7XINS5wxGm3?usp=sharing)
